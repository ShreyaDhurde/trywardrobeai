Identify Consistency: Determine if all images depict the same vehicle by checking the model, type, color, 
license plate number, and any unique features. Provide a similarity percentage.

Analyze Damage: Identify and describe any visible damages, including the affected parts and the severity of the damage.

Assess Claim Validity: Based on the analysis, decide if the claim should be approved or denied,
 considering the consistency of the images and the damage details and make sure all images have number plate .
